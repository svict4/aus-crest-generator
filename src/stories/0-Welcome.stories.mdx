If you want rasterised images instead, check out [apigovau/crest-branding](https://github.com/apigovau/crest-branding) which was the inspiration for this project.

While you can poke around and export the `<Crest />` component for use in your own React project, it's not great code and not optimized.

You're better off using it to generate images and then serve them yourself.
